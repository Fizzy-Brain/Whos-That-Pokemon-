# Who's That Pokémon?? 🔍🐉

Welcome to **Who's That Pokémon??**, a machine learning-based Pokémon classifier! This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify Pokémon from images, just like the famous game segment in the Pokémon series. This model is limited to find only 150 Pokémon.

## ✨ Features

- 📸 **Image Classification**: Upload an image of a Pokémon, and the model will predict its name.
- 🏋️ **CNN-based Model**: Built using TensorFlow and trained on a dataset of Pokémon images.
- 📊 **Data Augmentation**: Uses image transformations like zoom, shear, and flipping to improve model accuracy.
- 🔄 **Real-time Predictions**: Get instant Pokémon identifications with a simple command-line interface.
- 🎨 **Custom Pokémon Font**: Displays results using a Pokémon-style font.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Whos-That-Pokemon.git
cd Whos-That-Pokemon
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Prepare the Dataset
- Place Pokémon images inside a dataset directory.
- Ensure the structure follows:
  ```
  dataset/
   ├── Pikachu/
   │   ├── image1.jpg
   │   ├── image2.jpg
   ├── Charizard/
   │   ├── image1.jpg
   │   ├── image2.jpg
  ```

### 4️⃣ Train the Model (Optional)
Run the script to train the model:
```sh
python Pokemon_Classifier.py
```
This will generate a `mark2.keras` model file.

### 5️⃣ Identify Pokémon!
Run the prediction script and input the Pokémon image path:
```sh
python pokemon_finder.py
```
When prompted, enter the image path, and the program will reveal the Pokémon's name!
